# Unit2_InternTheory.com Clone
This project is made for educational purpose

The project is a clone of interntheory.com which provides Internship opportunities across India.

In the course of the second unit here at Masai School, we learned HTML and CSS along with JS DOM, Constructor functions, Prototype and Inheritance, the usage of local storage and client Server Model, Asynchronous Programming, and Promises.

At the end of our second unit, we were given a project as a part of our curriculum. We are assigned a website to clone as a construct week project. In this project we have to use all the skills we have learned till then.
